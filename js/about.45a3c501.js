Basically, Japanese has a few quirks in its sentence structure that has some interesting effects. The first is that each part of the sentence always depends on something to its right. The second is that every Japanese sentence ends in a verb/copula. This means that each line of dependencies is by itself a completely valid Japanese sentence. </div><div class="content"><h1 class="title">How do I use it?</h1> Put in a Japanese sentence, and either hit the auto-generate button, or manually create the flow by inserting the character <code>|</code> between chunks of the sentence and linking them together using the table provided. </div><div class="content"><h1 class="title">Any caveats?</h1> Of course, languages are always evolving and there are always exceptions. The main one would be people taking poetic license on the Japanese sentence structure. Specifically, a thing called 「<a rel="nofollow noreferrer" href="https://japanese.stackexchange.com/questions/14524/what-exactly-is-%e4%bd%93%e8%a8%80%e6%ad%a2%e3%81%9f%e3%81%84%e3%81%92%e3%82%93%e3%81%a9%e3%82%81">体言止め</a>」. The way the website is coded and also the dependency parser I used would probably not like it if you put one of those sentences in. Also, the dependency parser is about 90% accurate, so don&#39;t put complete trust in it. </div><div class="content"><h1 class="title">Who made this?</h1> Hello. I&#39;m Thomas. You can find my blog about language learning <a href="https://barelylingual.net/"> here</a>, and the code for this project can be found <a href="https://github.com/tchin25/jp-dependency-diagrams-visualizer"> here</a>. If you like this project, consider giving it a star on there because making something like this has zero return on investment for me. </div></div>',1);function o(e,t){return Object(s["r"])(),Object(s["d"])("div",n,[i])}const c={};c.render=o;t["default"]=c}}]);
